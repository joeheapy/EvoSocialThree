| Column                        | What it tells you (in everyday terms)                                                                                                                              |

| **Sector / Actor**            | Which organisation or group we’re talking about—e.g. central government, local authorities, charities, businesses.                                                 |
| **Strategy ID**               | A short code (such as “CG-1”) that labels one particular course of action for that actor.                                                                          |
| **Commitment**                | How much effort or money the actor puts into the strategy: **High**, **Medium** or **Low**.                                                                        |
| **Δ effect** (“delta effect”) | The estimated impact on the headline problem. A **negative** number means the strategy _reduces_ the problem; a **positive** number means it _makes things worse_. |
| **Private cost**              | Roughly how expensive or awkward the strategy is for the actor itself—higher numbers mean a bigger burden.                                                         |
| **Pay-off**                   | The actor’s overall gain after weighing the social benefit against its own cost. Higher pay-off values make a strategy more attractive to that actor.              |
