# Default text for the problem input form

# DEFAULT_PROBLEM_TEXT = "Low-income families in the United Kingdom face significant challenges accessing and affording fresh, nutritious foods. This problem creates and perpetuates health disparities, reduces quality of life, and imposes substantial long-term costs on individuals, communities, and healthcare systems."

# DEFAULT_PROBLEM_TEXT = "Prisons across the UK hold far more people than they were built for around 88,000 prisoners against a capacity of below 80,000. Chronic overcrowding strains safety, rehabilitation and staff, fuelling violence, reoffending and long-term public costs."

# DEFAULT_PROBLEM_TEXT = "Thousands are forced to sleep rough or rely on temporary shelters as rents rise and welfare lags. In 2024, rough sleeping in England jumped 32%, with nearly 12,000 people on London’s streets alone, undermining health, work prospects and community cohesion."

# DEFAULT_PROBLEM_TEXT = "Millions live in social homes blighted by damp, mould and structural hazards. Awaab’s Law now obliges landlords to investigate within 14 days, yet chronic under-investment keeps many properties sub-standard, harming residents’ health and widening inequality."

DEFAULT_PROBLEM_TEXT = "The UK's ageing population, with 22 million people over 50 in England alone, is placing immense strain on the NHS. The Darzi report identifies this demographic shift as the main driver of rising healthcare demand. The number of people over 85 is set to increase by 55% in the next 15 years. This surge is intensifying pressure on services, lengthening waiting lists, stretching staff capacity, increasing costs, and worsening health inequalities across all age groups."
