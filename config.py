# Default text for the problem input form

# DEFAULT_PROBLEM_TEXT = "Low-income families in the United Kingdom face significant challenges accessing and affording fresh, nutritious foods. This problem creates and perpetuates health disparities, reduces quality of life, and imposes substantial long-term costs on individuals, communities, and healthcare systems."

# DEFAULT_PROBLEM_TEXT = "Prisons across the UK hold far more people than they were built for—around 88,000 prisoners against a “decent” capacity below 80,000. Chronic overcrowding strains safety, rehabilitation and staff, fuelling violence, re-offending and long-term public costs."

DEFAULT_PROBLEM_TEXT = "Thousands are forced to sleep rough or rely on temporary shelters as rents rise and welfare lags. In 2024, rough sleeping in England jumped 32%, with nearly 12,000 people on London’s streets alone, undermining health, work prospects and community cohesion."

# DEFAULT_PROBLEM_TEXT = "Millions live in social homes blighted by damp, mould and structural hazards. “Awaab’s Law” now obliges landlords to investigate within 14 days, yet chronic under-investment keeps many properties sub-standard, harming residents’ health and widening inequality."
